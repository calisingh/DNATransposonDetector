# DNATransposonDetector
Repeated DNA is what makes up a large portion of a species' genome, and some of these DNA elements are able to move within the genome, we refer to them as transposons and retrotransposons. Transposons in the DNA move from one location to another by a duplicating mechanism. When it comes to cancer cells, these DNA transposons can be used to introduce a piece of external DNA into a genome, which can result in harmful recombinations to a human body. With neighbors around, transposition process copies to adjacent DNA. For this project, using Java, I implemented a detector that models the sequencing activity of ACGT (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine) to pinpoint cancer cells.
